FAQ Section Assignment

Overview
This project is a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) section built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can click on a question to reveal its answer, and it works on both desktop and mobile screens.

How It Works
The page has two main sections: the left side contains the heading and description, while the right side contains the FAQ items. Each FAQ item has a question and a hidden answer. When a user clicks a question, JavaScript adds an active state to show the answer and changes the icon from `+` to `-`. Clicking again hides the answer.

CSS is used to style the layout, colors, fonts, and animations. Answers are initially hidden and smoothly expand when active. The section is responsive, so it adjusts layout and font sizes for smaller screens.

Prompt:

How can I create a responsive FAQ section using HTML and CSS where the left side contains a heading and description text, and the right side contains FAQ questions? I want it to appear as two columns on desktop and stack vertically on mobile.

How can I create an FAQ questions section using HTML and CSS where each question can be expanded and collapsed with a plus and minus icon?
